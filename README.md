# Wayfarer

Wayfarer is a travel app aimed specifically at enabling users to post nightlife stories and tips for the cities of their choice. 

## Purpose

Wayfarer was created as an exercise in building a full stack application for a client. While the team shared quite a bit of creative input, final say was given to our clients.

## Technology

This full stack application was built using the Django framework for all models, views, and templating. 

The open source database, PostgreSQL, was used to hold all data. 

Vanilla CSS and the Skeleton framework were used for styling. 

JavaScript and JQuery were used for DOM manipulation.

And of course, HTML was used for the structure of our various pages.

## User Experience

When a user signs in to Wayfarer, they will be greeted by a homepage with images of well-known cities at night, along with basic descriptions at the bottom of the page. 

The navbar at the top features options for signing up for an account, loggin into an account, and visiting the about page. 

Once logged in, the navbar will dynamically adjust with options for our city/post page, the profile page, logging out, and the about page.

The city/post page will display a list of cities on the left side. If a user selects a city, the right side of the page will populate with a large image of the city along with any posts that currently exist for that city. Users can navigate to the detail page of individual posts and create new posts as well.

The profile page offers basic information and the ability to edit profile info. In addition, the user can see all their posts and can navigate to the individual post pages. 

## Challenges

Throughout this project, we found many points where it felt like we were wrestling with Django instead of working with it. 

For instance, it was difficult to understand the flow of data and how to obtain and manipulate the correct data (particularly pk's) when building out routes and grabbing information from forms. 

While this learning curve didn't stop us from building out our functionality, they were often the points that we spent the most time on.

In addition, this left us with less time to style the page than the team would have preferred. This is, of course, part of the challenge in building an application in a week, but we may have done better with a more consistent approach to our css structures.

Lastly, we would have liked to adjust our css to accomodate different screen sizes, but this functionality was left out due to a lack of time.

## Victories

This entire application presented moments of intensive learning followed by successful implementation of the technologies chosen. Every member of the team grew and saw their code come to life in ways previously unexplored. 

In particular, we found great success in the later stages of development with handling the flow of data and dynamically adjusting the user experience based on the various inputs they could enter.

With more time to style the application, we feel that our Wayfarer could be a professional application used by users the world over!
